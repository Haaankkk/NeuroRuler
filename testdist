# This script allows you to test the package
# It uninstalls NeuroRuler, builds the package, and installs NR locally
# This script should be sourced so that cd works
# Run with . ./testdist

rm -r dist
pip uninstall NeuroRuler -y
python3 setup.py sdist
# There will be only one file
for file in dist/*; do
    pip install $file;
done

# Need to test from directory that isn't NeuroRuler/
# Importing NeuroRuler stuff from NeuroRuler directory will import from the NeuroRuler directory
# Not the pip package
