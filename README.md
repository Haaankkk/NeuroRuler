NeuroRuler is a program that calculates head circumference from MRI data (`.nii`, `.nii.gz`, `.nrrd`).

## Install

Your Python version needs to be 3.8+. Check with `python --version`. Install with pip.

```sh
pip install NeuroRuler
```

If `pip` doesn't work, try `pip3`.

If contributing to this repo, clone/fork and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install additional development dependencies (for code formatting, documentation, etc.). After installing additional dependencies, run `pre-commit install` to enable pre-commit actions.

## Run GUI

Run these commands in a Python terminal:

```py
from NeuroRuler.GUI import gui
gui()
```

Note: If you make changes to the repo, use the [gui.py](https://github.com/NIRALUser/NeuroRuler/blob/main/gui.py) script to run the GUI. Changes you make will not be reflected in the pip package until uploaded to PyPI.

## Import/export image settings JSON

In "circumference mode" (after clicking Apply), click the large Export button under the image to export image setting JSON file(s) containing the circumferences of all loaded images and the settings applied to each image.

You can then use File > Import Image Settings to import an image setting JSON to load the same image with the same settings.

Here is an example:

```py
{
    "input_image_path": "/Users/jesse/Documents/GitHub/COMP523/NeuroRuler/data/MicroBiome_1month_T1w.nii.gz",
    "output_contoured_slice_path": "/Users/jesse/Documents/GitHub/COMP523/NeuroRuler/output/MicroBiome_1month_T1w/MicroBiome_1month_T1w_contoured.png",
    "circumference": 285.04478394448125,
    "x_rotation": -17,
    "y_rotation": -18,
    "z_rotation": 24,
    "slice": 131,
    "smoothing_conductance": 4.0,
    "smoothing_iterations": 10,
    "smoothing_time_step": 0.08,
    "threshold_filter": "Otsu"
}
```

When multiple images are exported, the output directory structure looks like this:

```text
output
â”œâ”€â”€ 150649_V06_t1w
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 150649_V06_t1w_contoured.png
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 150649_V06_t1w_settings.json
â””â”€â”€ MicroBiome_1month_T1w
    â”œâ”€â”€ MicroBiome_1month_T1w_contoured.png
    â””â”€â”€ MicroBiome_1month_T1w_settings.json
```

## Configure settings

After cloning the repo, edit the JSON configuration files [gui_config.json](https://github.com/NIRALUser/NeuroRuler/blob/main/gui_config.json) and [cli_config.json](https://github.com/NIRALUser/NeuroRuler/blob/main/cli_config.json).

You can also supply CLI arguments to the [gui.py](https://github.com/NIRALUser/NeuroRuler/blob/main/gui.py) or [cli.py](https://github.com/NIRALUser/NeuroRuler/blob/main/cli.py) scripts, which will override settings in the JSON configuration files.

Apply the `-h` command-line option when running those scripts to see the list of options. You can see some examples of CLI options in [test_cli.py](https://github.com/NIRALUser/NeuroRuler/blob/main/tests/test_cli.py).

## Run tests

To test locally, run `pytest`.

Our algorithm tests assert that our GUI calculations have at least a 0.98 R<sup>2</sup> value with ground truth data from the old Head Circumference Tool. Additionally, we test that our CLI and GUI produce the same results. Lastly, we verified that our circumference result is correct for images with non-(1.0, 1.0, 1.0) pixel spacing.

Our tests run on GitHub Actions on push and PR via `tox` ([tests.yml](https://github.com/NIRALUser/NeuroRuler/blob/main/.github/workflows/tests.yml)). If the image below says "passing," then the tests are passing.

## Pre-commit actions

Run `pre-commit install` to enable pre-commit actions.

Before each commit, the actions in [.pre-commit-config.yaml](https://github.com/NIRALUser/NeuroRuler/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml) will be run. Specifically, code will be reformatted with `black`.

**Note**: Some file names are excluded, so don't name any source code files those names.

## Release

To test the package locally before releasing, use the [testdist](https://github.com/NIRALUser/NeuroRuler/blob/main/testdist) script. If using macOS, run with `. ./testdist`. If using Windows, you may need to modify the script slightly.

You must test from a directory that isn't `NeuroRuler/`. If your directory is `NeuroRuler/`, then imports will import from the source code, not the package.

To publish to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/NeuroRuler/), edit the version number in [setup.py](https://github.com/NIRALUser/NeuroRuler/blob/main/setup.py). Then push to a branch called `release-pypi` (create it if it doesn't exist). This will trigger [pypi.yml](https://github.com/NIRALUser/NeuroRuler/blob/main/.github/workflows/pypi.yml), which will run tests and publish to PyPI if the tests pass.

To publish to [Test PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/NeuroRuler/), do the same as above, but push to a branch called `release-testpypi`.
